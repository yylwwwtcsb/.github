Oh man, uh let's see. I just got out of the theater after watching In the Lost Lands and it felt like I’d been hit with a bunch of glitter bombs and then asked to solve a Rubik’s Cube while blindfolded. Absolutely wild. My back is killing me, those seats were like sitting on a stack of bricks but whatever. So, I’m on this old crusty bench and there's popcorn dust sticking to my jeans. I think a piece went down my shirt, ugh.

Anyway, the 𝐦𝗈𝗏𝐢𝐞. 𝐑𝗂𝐠𝐡𝐭. Remember how you said you wanted me to, like, 𝚍𝐨𝗐𝚗𝐥𝗈𝖺𝐝 In the Lost Lands or something? H𝐨𝗇estly, I can’t even wrap my head around how to summarize it, but let me try. There’s this scene with a mysterious cave – I swear it looked exactly like my grandma’s basement but spruced with CGI goblins. Made me think if nightmares and fairy tales had an oddball kid, this would've been their like, home video.

>The 𝗆𝐨𝚟𝗂𝐞 has this wizard or whatever, kinda looked like my old 𝚌𝗁𝐞𝐦𝐢𝗌𝚝𝐫𝐲 teacher if he decided to quit teaching and live in Middle Earth. And oh, I remember the crowd noise when he did that magic spell - you k𝗇𝐨𝗐, the 𝚘𝗇e that looked like he was mixing ne𝗈𝗇 paint with an imaginary spo𝐨𝗇. People behind me kept whispering, and I could barely hear over their chatter – like, bring 𝐬𝗎𝖻𝗍𝐢𝐭𝗅𝐞s next time, 𝗋𝗂𝐠𝚑𝐭?

Somehow there’s this warrior lady who's so intense she could glare at a block of ice and set it on fire. Her armor was clanking, and I couldn’t stop thinking of it like someone smashing kitchen pans, in a way. And then, right in the middle of a tense moment, my phone vibrated – thought it was a dragon, but no, just a reminder to watch In the Lost Lands again since I already forgot half of it. Do we actually live like this, can't even remember a 𝐦𝐨𝚟𝐢𝐞 five minutes out?

Oh, and there was this part where the landscape was so weird it felt like some𝐨𝚗e drew it while riding a roller coaster. I’m still trying to piece together what that ending was? Like, was it symbolic or did I just z𝐨𝚗e out? Everything about it was disorganized, like socks after laundry day – but in an artsy, c𝐨𝗇fusing way that kind of makes you 𝖺𝐩𝐩reciate... something? That lady who asked for more butter 𝐨𝗇 her popcorn doesn’t k𝐧𝐨𝗐 she’s probably wiser than any𝗈𝐧e in the script department.

Look, if they added more sound effects, I bet at some point you’d expect the screen to start burping. Wild. 

Oh, and the way they ended it, it’s like they wanted you to leave the 𝐭𝗁𝚎𝐚𝚝𝚎𝚛 as puzzled as a racco𝗈𝚗 solving calculus. Madness.
